    <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm currently in my first semester of the Interactive Media Design program. I was convinced I wouldn't be able to start until September because I hadn't been accepted and was stuck on the waitlist, but luckily the timing worked out. I moved in with some other Algonquin students on Thursday, got my acceptance email just in the nick of time on Friday afternoon, and then began my first day of school on Monday. Just barely made it in.

    So far my two favourite classes are Digital Graphics and Web Dev. I love doing digital art as a hobby, especially when bringing scenes from books to life. So I'm already familiar with Photoshop but I've wanted to learn Illustrator for a long time and it's nice to actually do that. When it comes to Web Dev, I haven't played with <abbr>HTML</abbr> since I was a kid, and I was never all that good at it. So it's been fun brushing up.
